    <h3> As you turn to leave, your senses still on high alert, you step cautiously, mindful of potential dangers. However, in your vigilance, you fail to notice the subtle pressure plate concealed beneath a layer of fallen leaves just outside the shelter's entrance.</h3>

<h3>With a sudden click, the trap is triggered, setting off a chain reaction that you're powerless to stop. Before you can react, a hidden mechanism is activated, causing the ground beneath you to give way. </h3>

<h3> You plummet into a concealed pitfall, the air rushing past you as you fall into darkness. With a bone-jarring impact, you land at the bottom of the pit, dazed and disoriented. </h3>

<h3> As you struggle to your feet, you realize that escape will not be easy. The pit is deep, and its walls are slick with moss, offering little in the way of footholds. Panic sets in as you realize the gravity of your predicament. </h3>
      <h3> With no way to climb out and no one to hear your cries for help, you're left to ponder the unfortunate turn of events that led you to this moment</h3>

 <h3>Trapped in a pitfall triggered by a booby trap, your adventure in the enchanted forest takes a perilous turn. Perhaps someone will find you before you starve. </h3>
    <h3> Would you like to try another adventure? </h3>
