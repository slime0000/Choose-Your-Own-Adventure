    <h3> As you turn your attention from the glowing object, your attention is suddenly captured by the melodic chirping of a colorful bird perched high in the branches above. Mesmerized by its vibrant plumage and enchanting song, you find yourself drawn to it, forgetting to watch your footing. </h3>
      <h3> Unaware of the peril looming below, you step onto a precarious branch, its surface worn smooth by the passage of time. With a sudden crack, the branch gives way beneath your weight, sending you tumbling from the tree.</h3>
      <h3> You flail desperately, trying to grab hold of something to break your fall, but the ground rushes up to meet you with alarming speed and darkness envelops your vision.

 <h3>Sorry, but it seems your adventure has come to a tragic end. </h3>
    <h3> Would you like to try another adventure? </h3>
