    <h3> As you approach the source of the mysterious noises, a sense of unease washes over you, but your curiosity compels you forward. With each step, the rustling grows louder, echoing through the forest like a haunting melody. </h3>
      <h3> Suddenly, from the shadows emerges a fearsome creature, its eyes gleaming with malice. Before you can react, it pounces with lightning speed, its claws slashing through the air.</h3>
      <h3> You attempt to defend yourself, but the creature's strength is overwhelming. In a flurry of motion, it overwhelms you, its fangs sinking into your flesh. Agony courses through your body as darkness envelops your vision.</h3>

 <h3>Your journey in the enchanted forest comes to a sudden and tragic end, a cautionary tale of the dangers that lurk within its depths. </h3>
    <h3> Would you like to try another adventure? </h3>
