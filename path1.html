    <h3> As you continue along the path, the flickering lights guide you deeper into the heart of the enchanted forest. The air grows thick with magic, and the trees seem to whisper secrets as you pass by. You walk for what feels like hours, losing track of time as you become entranced by the beauty of your surroundings.</h3>

<h3>Suddenly, you realize that the path ahead seems to stretch on endlessly, with no end in sight. No matter how far you walk, you never seem to make any progress. The forest seems to have trapped you in an endless loop, condemned to wander its twisting paths forever. <br> </h3>

 <h3>Sometimes, even the most inviting paths can lead to unforeseen consequences. </h3>
    <h3> Would you like to try another adventure? </h3>
