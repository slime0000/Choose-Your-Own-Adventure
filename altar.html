    <h3> As you approach the mysterious stone altar, you feel a sense of trepidation but are drawn to its enigmatic carvings. Running your fingers over its smooth surface, you try to decipher the ancient symbols etched into the stone.</h3>

Suddenly, a surge of magic emanates from the altar, enveloping you in its power. You feel your life force being drained away, your very essence consumed by the potent magic of the forest. </h3>

<h3> In a final, desperate attempt to break free, you struggle against the overwhelming force, but it's futile. Your vision blurs, and darkness engulfs you as you succumb to the altar's deadly enchantment. </h3>

<h3> Your adventure in the enchanted forest ends in tragedy, a cautionary tale of the dangers that lurk within its depths. </h3>

 <h3>I'm sorry that your journey in the enchanted forest has met such a grim fate. Perhaps another adventure awaits you elsewhere. </h3>
    <h3> Would you like to try another adventure? </h3>
