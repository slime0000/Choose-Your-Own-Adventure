    <h3> You're feeling a little sleepy so you decide to lay down and take a nap on the soft moss of the forest floor. You slowly drift off as you listen to the birds chirping and the wind gently blowing throught the trees. </h3>
<h3> As you gradually regain consciousness, you find yourself lying on your back, surrounded by the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy above. Blinking away the remnants of sleep, you become aware of a weight pressing down on your stomach.</h3>
      <h3>With a sense of curiosity and wonder, you glance down to find a small fox curled up comfortably on your abdomen, its fur warm and soft against your skin. Its chest rises and falls rhythmically with each breath, and its eyes flutter open to meet yours.</h3>
      <h3> Looks like you'll be stuck here for a while. </h3>
<h3>Stuck in a state of enforced stillness, you find unexpected beauty and tranquility in the simple act of observing and listening. </h3>
