    <h3> As you approach the crystal-clear river, you're filled with determination to cross it. Without hesitation, you dive in and start swimming across, the cool water enveloping you. However, as you reach the middle of the river, you begin to feel fatigued. The current is stronger than you anticipated, and your arms and legs grow heavy.</h3><br>

<h3>Despite your best efforts, you find it increasingly difficult to keep your head above water. Panic sets in as you struggle against the relentless pull of the river. Your breath grows short, and darkness starts creeping into your vision. </h3><br>

<h3>With a final gasp for air, you succumb to exhaustion, and the river claims you, dragging you beneath its surface.</h3><br>

<h3>The once tranquil river now becomes your watery grave. <br> </h3>

 <h3>I'm sorry to say that your adventure has ended tragically. Swimming in unfamiliar waters can be perilous. </h3>
<h3> Would you like to try another adventure? </h3>
