    <h3> You cautiously enter the shelter and discover a few items left behindâ€”a rusted knife, a tattered blanket, and a worn journal. As you flip through the pages of the journal, you uncover tales of a lost adventurer who once called this forest home. </h3>
      <h3> You decide to take the journal with you, intrigued by the stories it contains. Perhaps it holds clues to further adventures in the forest.</h3>

<h3>Congratulations! You've uncovered a piece of the forest's history and completed your adventure. </h3>
